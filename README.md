## My process

  I really enjoyed this project. It made me really get in trouch with tailwindcss. It also allowed me to practice making responsive websites. I still have a lot to learn when it comes to tailwind, css, and responsive web-design, but I'm so excited to continue on this journy. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

  I learned tailwindCss and responsive web design 

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center mb-8 md:mb-10">
        <button class="bg-primary-brightblue w-72 p-3 mb-5 md:w-80 rounded-lg md:mb-5 text-white hover:shadow-xl hover:brightness-150" ><a href="/">Proceed to Payment</a></button>
        <h4 class=" cursor-pointer text-neutral-coolblue font-bold text-sm hover:text-neutral-darkyblue">Cancel Order</h4>
</div>

```

### Continued development

  I really want to figure out how to add the waved background. It stumped me for sure. For the future, I would also love to implement this code in less time. It took me around 4-5 hours to create this, but I was getting faster near the end once I got the hang of Tailwind. Maybe I could also implement with react to make it functional.

### Useful resources

- [TailwincCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me through the entire project. I often looked back at the docs to remind myself of things I wanted to include.
